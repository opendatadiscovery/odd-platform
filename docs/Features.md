## Federation Data Catalogue
The Catalogue is a tool which helps to bring distributed catalogues together in the Platform. \
\
**How it works.** You connect each catalogue to the Platform &rarr; It pulls the data without postprocessing (statistics creation and data cleansing are not supported) to save in ODD servers &rarr; The data from each source automatically occurs in a Platform account. \
\
To collect data from decentralized sources ODD uses a pull strategy (read more about strategies [here](Architecture.md#push-and-pull-strategies)). \
To connect your data sources with the Platform use the [API](https://github.com/opendatadiscovery/odd-platform/tree/main/odd-platform-specification).
