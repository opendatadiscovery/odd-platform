### Adapters
> :exclamation: Adapters will be deprecated soon! To use all features and recent updates of the Platform, we recommend you to install the [Collector](Architecture.md#collector).

Adapters are lightweight services that gather metadata in a standardized format. They are designed to be source-specific and expose only the information that could be gathered from a particular data source.

### Push-client

A Push-client is a provider which sends information directly to the central repository of the Platform.

The diagram below shows principles of data exchange between ODD and your in-house components.

## Push and pull strategies

The metadata discovery process is very similar to that of gathering metrics,logs and traces. It can be done through a pull or push model (or both). Each of the models has a range of use cases it suits best. ODD uses both models to effectively cover all core use cases.

### Pull strategy

Pulling metadata directly from the source is the most straightforward way of gathering it. However, an attempt to develop and maintain a centralized fleet of domain-specific crawlers can easily become a problem.\
Pulling data from multiple sources without having a standard compels to use multiple source-specific crawlers for each adapter, which is a complex and ineffective solution. ODD solves this issue by providing a universal adapter.\
Pull model is preferred when:
* There is no need to get immediate data updates.
* You have already applied one of ODD adapters to your data sources.

### Push strategy

Push strategy supports a process where individual metadata providers push the information to the central ODD repository. This strategy solves a problem of immediate data receiving from ETL / ELT engines that have no public APIs or if it's not possible to import the required data using an existing API. The Push is more preferred for use cases like Airflow job runs and quality check runs.
