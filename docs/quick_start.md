# Quick Start
## Main steps
1. To understand how the ODD works and what features it has, setup (??) a local demo invironment (link).
2. Set required parameters for the Collector and fro the Platfrom (link).
3. Deploy the Collector and the Platfrom using Helm (link). Also to connect custom microservices to the ODD, deploy the Tracing Gateway (link).     
## Next steps
This section provides recomendations for those who have successfully connected required datasources to the Platfrom and are ready to use ODD features.
